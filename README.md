# Chat_1_to_1_pro
Here is my First Python program where we can simple chat through python socket concept
prerequisite Ngrok or any portforwarding tools to expose the port 2222.

This repo consist of two python program and one shell script which install the python in linux ( you can manually install the python)
Chat_server program is basically program where we simply run this that program through python3 interpreter after that open another terminal and simple tunnel the ngork to the specific port of that server.

second program is client_side Program where we only need the ip address of the server side and port i.e 2222 by default.

simply pull this code and run.
